                    <p>"The Museum is committed to telling the stories of forced removals, and assisting in the
                        reconstitution of the community of District Six and Cape Town by drawing on a heritage of
                        non-racialism, non-sexism, anti-class discrimination and the encouragement of debate".</p>
                    <p>The District Six Museum is a heritage project in itself. Part of its mission is to provide the
                        space for former inhabitants of District Six to share and explore their memories and develop new
                        interpretations of both the past and the present. The museum also functions as a forum where
                        debate and policy development is initiated.</p>
                    <p>The District Six Museum houses an impressive collection of historical materials including
                        photographs, paintings, artefacts, physical remains like street signs, books and studies as well
                        as audio-visual recordings of District Six, most which were donated by its former residents</p>

                        and shared, stories are told and knowledge is passed from one generation to the next.</p>

                    <p>Greenmarket Square is one of the liveliest hubs in Cape Town. It’s the second oldest public
                        space in Cape Town, after the Grand Parade. There are many things to do at Greenmarket Square,
                        from exploring the market and grabbing a bite to eat, to exploring the art and discovering the
                        story of the historic cobbled square.<p>
                    <p>Greenmarket Square was first established in 1696, in the first century of Dutch occupation of
                        the Cape colony. Since the days of its inception it has served many a purpose, some more
                        admirable than others.</p>
                    <p>It was first used as a market square where fresh vegetables grown at the nearby Company’s Garden
                        were sold, along with slaves. A well was also built here, where citizens could fetch water
                        during the dry summer months when the streams off Table Mountain ran dry.</p>
